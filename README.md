# natural_selection_simulation
A simulation of the evolution of simple creatures through natural selection

The creatures in this environment can evolve to grow or shrink in size. 

Larger creatures might eat smaller ones, but also need more food in order to survive and populate.
Smaller creatures might move faster and need less food in order to survive and populate.

For most parameter settings, the population either converges to one "species" of creatures of very similar size,
or oscillates between a "species" of small creatures and a "species" of larger creatures being the only dominant specie.
The .png file named "branches_of_species" displays a result of a simulation where different sizes of creatures were "alive" at different times throughout the simulation. As can be seen, it is possible for a generation of similar sized creatures to branch out to creatures, which are very different from each other.

It would be interesting to find a parameter setting where the original "specie" could diverge into a small and a large one,
which were able to coexist. It is, however, possible that this would require the possibility for more different traits being
evolved than what the simulation contains at the moment.
